Project Summary

What the project is about:
This is a simple, responsive personal portfolio website. It has a header with navigation, a hero section with an image carousel, an About section, a Projects gallery, and a Contact form with social links. The goal is to show skills and work clearly on phones, tablets, and desktops.

What I learned:
- How to use semantic HTML for clear structure and accessibility.
- How to make a mobile-friendly menu with a small JavaScript toggle.
- How to build a lightweight CSS-only carousel using keyframes and flexbox.
- How to write media queries so layouts adapt across screen sizes.
- How to organize assets (moved images into an images/ folder) and write helpful alt text.

Challenges I overcame:
- Making the navigation work well on small screens (hamburger toggle and ARIA attributes).
- Getting carousel images to scale without stretching, using object-fit and aspect-ratio.
- Keeping project cards readable and consistent at different breakpoints with flexbox and hover effects.
- Updating links and section IDs (Portfolio â†’ Projects) and keeping anchor links consistent.
